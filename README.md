# SWP391-QuizPractice
Overview

QuizPractice is a web application aimed at developing a quiz practice system that supports organizations/experts in building and selling quiz practice services, and helps users search, register, and access online subjects for practice.

This project was undertaken by me and 4 other friends as part of the SWP391 subject (Application Development Project) at FPT University.

Description
There are 6 actors involved in our system:

• Guest: unregistered users

• Customer: registered users who are actual or potential customers

• Sale: sales members of the organization

• Expert: access and prepare the course/test contents as assigned by admin

• Admin: the organization leader/manager, acting as the system administrator

Tech stack used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
Backend: Java Servlet
Database: MS SQL Server

What I Learned 

I never knew how challenging it is to create a fully functional website until I started this project. It taught me to apply the Agile methodology, from defining the requirements, designing the wireframes, to constantly coding and testing what we have done. Most of all, it taught me how to work as a team lead and cooperate with my teammates on a project. Finally, I learned that everything has a solution as long as we keep brainstorming, stay calm in tough times, and believe in what we are doing.

Last but not least, this project would never have succeeded without my friends' support and our team's tremendous teamwork effort. It has been a blessing to work on this project.

Project progress: 62%
